### How I Got Here:
      My love for coding and the development world has started since I was little. Starting from my father being a stay-at-home dad,
      and a web designer. I wanted to be able to do the same thing as him, or at least something like it. However, I had to focus on 
      schooling and never got the time to truly sit down and learn how to code. Now after the pandemic, a lot of my usual activities
      that took up my time are gone, giving me more time to learn development and web design. Which has led me to today, learning 
      JavaScript, HTML5, and TypeScript.
